This is a MatLab/C++ library of [1].

The code supports arbitrary number of regions and inclusion and exclusion constraints.
The syntax is described in "example.m".

Requirements 
---
1. MATLAB and a c++ compiler.

Getting started
---
1. Run mex --setup.
2. Run example.m in MATLAB, the mex'ed c++ code compiles automatically.

All functionally is described in example.m

Third party software
---
* To calculate the correct weights for the regularization the code uses
  Sphere voronoi by John Burkardt [2].
  

* If you use the solver based on lagrangian duality, the code uses the max/flow min solver
	By Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov [3] which reuses flow as described [4].

* If you use roof duality, the code uses the QPBO software [5]

Martin Rykfors has written a more efficient solver 
if you problem only have inclusions and you are satisfied
with standard connectivities.
