This is a MATLAB/C++ for our multi-region segmentation paper [1].

The code supports segmentation with arbitrary number of regions, inclusion and exclusion constraints.

![Example](screenshot/multi-simple.png)

Results from a toy example.

Requirements 
---
1. MATLAB and a c++ compiler.

Getting started
---
1. Run mex -setup.
2. Run example.m in MATLAB, the mex'ed c++ code compiles automatically.

All functionally is described in example.m.

Third party software
---
* To calculate the correct weights for the regularization the code uses
  "Sphere voronoi" [2].
  

* If you use the solver based on lagrangian duality, the code uses the max/flow min solver
	by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov [3] which reuses flow as described in [4].

* If you use roof duality, the code uses the QPBO software [5].

Martin Rykfors has written a more efficient solver 
if your problem only have inclusions constraints and you are satisfied
with standard connectivities. More details in his [Master thesis](http://www.maths.lth.se/vision/education/pages/Rykfors12/exjobb.pdf) and his
[git repository](https://github.com/MartinRykfors/MultiRegion).
